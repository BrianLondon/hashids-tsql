# Hashids
A small set of TSQL functions to generate YouTube-like hashes from one or many numbers. 
Use hashids when you do not want to expose your database ids to the user.

[http://www.hashids.org/](http://www.hashids.org/)

## What is it?

hashids (Hash ID's) creates short, unique, decryptable hashes from unsigned integers.

This project is a port to TSQL of the other projects found via [http://www.hashids.org/](http://www.hashids.org/).
The .NET and Javascript versions of Hashids are the primary reference projects for this port.

The included hashids-tsql generator creates a custom set of TSQL functions to encode values with your chosen salt
and other options.

## Status

The SQL functions generated by hashids-tsql can currently encode numbers, but not decode them. The mssql database 
project (called HashidsTsql) contains a full set of pre-generated functions to test with. Also, see TODOs below.

## TSQL Function Naming

TSQL does not have function overloading, so the single `encode` function that is common in other hashids.org libraries
is instead represented here as a set of `encode` functions with slight variations in name, declaration and possibly even
return value.

The basic forms of `encode` for TSQL are:

- `encode1(int) string`
- `encode2(int, int) string`
- `encodeList(table) string`
- `encodeSplit(string, string) string`

In TSQL, the `encode` functions that take 1 or 2 integers will be much more useful than the one that takes a table
because typically, you don't want to construct a table variable just to pass 1 or 2 integers into a function.

There are multiple variations on each basic form, in order to return different int and string types (`varchar, nvarchar,
int, bigint`). `encode1A` returns a `varchar` (ASCII) value. `encode1B` accepts a `bigint`. `encode1BA` accepts a `bigint`
and returns a `varchar` (and so on).
   
## TODO

- Add options to include missing functions in the generator.
- Make an easier-to-maintain set of swig files.
- See other minor technical TODO items in hashids-tsql/app.js.
- Create all manner of automated tests, primarily to test against other implementations.
- Create TSQL functions for decoding and integrate them into the hashids-tsql generator.
