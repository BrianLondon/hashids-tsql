# Hashids
A small set of TSQL functions to generate YouTube-like hashes from one or many numbers. 
Use hashids when you do not want to expose your database ids to the user.

[http://www.hashids.org/](http://www.hashids.org/)

## What is it?

hashids (Hash ID's) creates short, unique, decryptable hashes from unsigned integers.

This project is a port to TSQL of the other projects found via [http://www.hashids.org/](http://www.hashids.org/).
The .NET and Javascript versions of Hashids are the primary reference projects for this port.

## Status

The SQL functions generated by hashids-tsql can currently encode numbers, but not decode them. The mssql database 
project (called HashidsTsql) contains 3 functions: consistentShuffle, encodeId and hash. To generate a new encodeId 
function with your custom salt, use the hashids-tsql generator.

Note: encodeId always has the default minHashLength value of 0.

## TODO

- Pretty-up the generator code in hashids-tsql/app.js to take options from the command line.
- Add hashids-tsql generator options for:
    - Salt value.
    - Database schema name.
    - Target database name.
    - Destination file.
- Modify hashids-tsql generator to output all (currently 3) functions needed for encodeId to work
by default, instead of just the encodeId function.
