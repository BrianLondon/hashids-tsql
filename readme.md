# Hashids
A small set of TSQL functions to generate YouTube-like hashes from one or many numbers. 
Use hashids when you do not want to expose your database ids to the user.

[http://www.hashids.org/](http://www.hashids.org/)

## What is it?

hashids (Hash ID's) creates short, unique, decryptable hashes from unsigned integers.

This project is a port to TSQL of the other projects found via [http://www.hashids.org/](http://www.hashids.org/).
The .NET and Javascript versions of Hashids are the primary reference projects for this port.

## Status

The SQL functions generated by hashids-tsql can currently encode numbers, but not decode them. The mssql database 
project (called HashidsTsql) contains 3 functions: consistentShuffle, encodeInt and hash. To generate a new encodeInt 
function with your custom salt, use the hashids-tsql generator.

## TODO

- Create a version of encodeInt called encodeIntN that generates NVARCHAR hashes.
- Create a version of encodeInt/N that encodes 2 numbers (encodeInt2/N2), so that each table can have it's own unique set of hashes.
- Create TSQL functions for decoding and integrate them into the hashids-tsql generator.
- See other mior technical TODO items in hashids-tsql/app.js.
